# Selenium DHL

Simple python script that uses Selenium to fix wrong postal codes in files that create shipments in DHL by another API.
If you want to use it, you need to have a DHL account.
After processing the file, it will move processed file with the fixed postal codes. to another folder. (defined in `.env` file)

## Prerequisites

### Selenium WebDriver

Download WebDrivers:
* [Firefox Driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Extract to drivers to: `C:/selenium_drivers`


Add directory with drivers to PATH:

```bash
#Powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\selenium_drivers"
```
### .env file
Change name of `env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials to DHL site.


## Usage
To run script use: `python main.py`

On first run you will be asked to create directories for files.
```bash
ðŸ”¥ Checking directories...
Directory APP_IN/ does not exist. Create it? [y/n]
Directory APP_OUT/ does not exist. Create it? [y/n]
Directory APP_OUT/OLD/ does not exist. Create it? [y/n]
Directory APP_ERROR/ does not exist. Create it? [y/n]
```

After init you can run script again to start processing.
You need `*.xml` files in `APP_IN` that script will parse.

Example .xml file:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<Shipment>
	<order>CXL7450948</order>
	<name>Karol KrÃ³lczyk</name>
	<street>Bociania</street>
	<houseNumber>63</houseNumber>
	<country>Polska</country>
	<postalCode>65-497</postalCode>
	<city>Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a</city>
</Shipment>
```
This example is provided by Faker library.
